#### Why we need explainability & interpretibility?

Essential for:
1. Model debugging - Why did my model make a mistake? How can I improve the accuracy of the model?
2. Detecting fairness issues - Is my model biased? If yes, where?
3. Human-AI cooperation - How can I understand and trust the model's decisions?
4. Regulatory compliance - Does my model satisfy legal & regulatory requirements?
5. High-risk applications - Healthcare, Financial Services, FinTech, Judicial, Security etc,.
